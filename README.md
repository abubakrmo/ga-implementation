GENETIC ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

This assignment implemented three different algorithms with the aim of evolving to a target string "Welcome to CS547!". The implemented algorithms are as follows: Genetic Algorithm, Hill climber and a random search

The language employed in writing these algorithms is JAVA and does not require any additional framework to be installed.

Once the zip file (assignmentOne) is downloaded and unzipped, three classes namely: GeneticAlgorithm, HillClimbing, RandomSolution can be accessed by this file path src/com/assignment.

Each of these three algorithms can be run independently by executing their respective java classes: 
1. Genetic Algorithm: Run the "GeneticAlgorithm.java" file.
2. HillClimber Algorithm: Run the "HillClimber.java" file.
3. Random Search: Run the "RandomSearch.java" file.
