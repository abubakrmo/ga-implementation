GENETIC ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

This project implement three algorithms with the aim of evolving to a target string "Welcome to CS547!". The three algorithms that were implemented are:
<ul>
  <li>Genetic Algorithm</li>
  <li>Hill Climber</li>
  <li>Random Search</li>
</ul>
This project was purely written in Java and does not require any additional framework to be installed.



Once the zip file (assignmentOne) is downloaded and unzipped, three classes namely: GeneticAlgorithm, HillClimbing, RandomSolution can be accessed by this file path src/com/assignment.

Each of these three algorithms can be run independently by executing their respective java classes: 
1. Genetic Algorithm: Run the "GeneticAlgorithm.java" file.
2. HillClimber Algorithm: Run the "HillClimber.java" file.
3. Random Search: Run the "RandomSearch.java" file.
